# TVListBeautifyApp

An android app to beautify lists of tv-show and movie names. It uses an API to gather Info about input tv-shows or movies and displays them in a watchlist.

As of now, I kind of stopped working on it a while ago, since I didn't really need it actually.

# Regarding The API-Key

I know the API-Key I used is still visible in this repository. It's an old one and not up-to-date anymore, so it's fine. This Repository was originally supposed to stay private, so I didn't make an effort to encrypt it in any way.

## ToDos

- Fix multiple bugs
- Design overhaul
